This guide uses the **exact content from your submitted photo** so the page looks the same. Follow every step in order.

**Spreadsheet:** [ApplyOnlyOnce - Loan Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eaYl0tfAiTR4AcAaBfqemsbMX8QFcX_yQZOQcD2kW7g/edit)

---

## Part 1: Open the sheet and set up columns

### Step 1.1 – Open the spreadsheet
1. Open the link above (or your ApplyOnlyOnce Google Sheet).
2. At the bottom, you see tabs (e.g. Config, Education_Loans_India, …).

### Step 1.2 – Create or select the Pro-Tips tab
1. If you already have a tab named **Pro-Tips_Before_You_Apply** or **Pro-Tips Before You Apply**, click it.
2. If not: click the **+** at the bottom left to add a new sheet.
3. Double‑click the new tab name and rename it to **Pro-Tips_Before_You_Apply** (use an underscore) or **Pro-Tips Before You Apply** (use a space). The website accepts either name.

### Step 1.3 – Row 1: column headers
1. Click cell **A1**.
2. Type: **section_heading**
3. Click cell **B1**.
4. Type: **block_type**
5. Click cell **C1**.
6. Type: **content**

So Row 1 looks like:

| A                | B           | C        |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| section_heading | block_type  | content  |

---

## Part 2: First section – “CIBIL / Credit score report” (heading + table)

### Step 2.1 – Section title only (Row 2)
1. Click cell **A2**.
2. Type: **CIBIL / Credit score report**
3. Click cell **B2**.
4. Type: **heading**
5. Leave cell **C2** empty (or put a space).

**Why:** This row only shows the section title on the page. The table comes in the next rows.

---

### Step 2.2 – Table header row (Row 3)
1. Click cell **A3**. Leave it **empty** (we are still in the same section).
2. Click cell **B3**. Type: **table_header**
3. Click cell **C3**. Here you type the **three column names** of the table, separated by the **pipe** character **|** (Shift + backslash on most keyboards, key above Enter).

**In C3 type exactly this** (copy-paste if you like):

```
Feature|Public & Private Sector Banks|NBFCs & Private Lenders
```

**Important:** There is **no space** before or after each **|**. The pipe separates the three columns. So the website will show:
- Column 1: Feature  
- Column 2: Public & Private Sector Banks  
- Column 3: NBFCs & Private Lenders  

---

### Step 2.3 – First table data row – Strictness (Row 4)
1. Click **A4**. Leave **empty**.
2. Click **B4**. Type: **table_row**
3. Click **C4**. Type (again use **|** between the three cells, no spaces around **|**):

```
Strictness|Extremely Strict. Zero tolerance for negative remarks.|Flexible. They prioritize the overall profile over minor credit issues.
```

---

### Step 2.4 – Second table row – Adverse Remarks (Row 5)
1. **A5** = empty  
2. **B5** = **table_row**  
3. **C5** = type:

```
Adverse Remarks|Instant Rejection for remarks like: Written Off, Settled, Post-Card, or high DPD (Days Past Due).|May accept past issues if the current financial standing is strong.
```

---

### Step 2.5 – Third table row – No Credit History (Row 6)
1. **A6** = empty  
2. **B6** = **table_row**  
3. **C6** = type:

```
No Credit History|Highly Preferred over a bad history. "No History" (NH/-1) is easily accepted.|Very common and widely accepted for students.
```

---

### Step 2.6 – Fourth table row – Interest Rates (Row 7)
1. **A7** = empty  
2. **B7** = **table_row**  
3. **C7** = type:

```
Interest Rates|Offers the lowest rates but requires a clean report.|May approve "riskier" profiles but often at a higher interest rate.
```

---

### Step 2.7 – Fifth table row – Co-Applicant Check (Row 8)
1. **A8** = empty  
2. **B8** = **table_row**  
3. **C8** = type:

```
Co-Applicant Check|Mandatory. Every co-applicant's report must be clean.|Focused primarily on the main financial co-applicant's stability.
```

---

### Step 2.8 – Sixth table row – Min. Score (Row 9)
1. **A9** = empty  
2. **B9** = **table_row**  
3. **C9** = type:

```
Min. Score|700+|600+
```

After this, the **CIBIL / Credit score report** section on the website will show the heading and the full 6-row table, exactly like in your photo.

---

## Part 3: Section “Check your Cibil report first:” (paragraph + link)

### Step 3.1 – Row 10
1. Click **A10**. Type: **Check your Cibil report first:**
2. Click **B10**. Type: **paragraph**
3. Click **C10**. Type the paragraph and the link. The link format is: **[the text you want to show](the URL)**.  
   So for “Click here” linking to CIBIL, you type **[Click here](https://www.cibil.com/)**.

**In C10 type exactly:**

```
Download your official CIBIL report for free. If it is 100% clean, apply to Banks; if there are any remarks, prioritize NBFCs. [Click here](https://www.cibil.com/)
```

On the website you will see the sentence and a clickable link that says **“Click here”** and goes to https://www.cibil.com/. You can change “Click here” to any name (e.g. “CIBIL website”) by changing only the part inside the square brackets: **[CIBIL website](https://www.cibil.com/)**.

---

## Part 4: Section “Limit Applications:” (paragraph only)

### Step 4.1 – Row 11
1. **A11** = **Limit Applications:**
2. **B11** = **paragraph**
3. **C11** = type:

```
Don't apply to 7+ banks at once. Each "Hard Pull" request can drop your score by 3-4 points. Instead, select the 4-5 lenders that best match your profile from the 35+ available.
```

---

## Part 5: Section “Protect Your Score:” (paragraph only)

### Step 5.1 – Row 12
1. **A12** = **Protect Your Score:**
2. **B12** = **paragraph**
3. **C12** = type:

```
Too many simultaneous requests will crash your score, making you ineligible for any future loans.
```

---

## Part 6: Section “Score vs History” (optional)

### Step 6.1 – Row 13
1. **A13** = **Score vs History**
2. **B13** = **paragraph**
3. **C13** = leave empty, or add any extra text you want for this section.

---

## Part 7: Check sharing and view on the website

### Step 7.1 – Sharing
1. In the spreadsheet, click **Share** (top right).
2. Under **General access**, set to **Anyone with the link** and **Viewer**.
3. Save. The website can only load the data if the sheet is shared like this.

### Step 7.2 – See the result
1. Open **http://localhost:8765/pages/pro-tips.html** (with `npm run serve` running), or your live Pro-Tips page.
2. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or F5).
3. You should see:
   - Main title “Pro-Tips Before You Apply”
   - Section **CIBIL / Credit score report** with the 3-column table (Feature, Public & Private Sector Banks, NBFCs & Private Lenders) and all 6 rows
   - Section **Check your Cibil report first:** with the paragraph and a **Click here** link to CIBIL
   - Section **Limit Applications:** with the paragraph
   - Section **Protect Your Score:** with the paragraph
   - Section **Score vs History** (with or without extra text)
